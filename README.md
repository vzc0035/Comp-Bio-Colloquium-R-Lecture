# Comp-Bio-Colloquium-R-Lecture
I chose this subject because I use R a lot for statistics, as Iâ€™m sure a lot of people in this class do. Using the way I convey my data as an example dataset, it got me thinking about my own data analysis and how to potentially improve it.
The target audience is for an undergrad or graduate student who knows a little bit about statistics and would potentially know how to run a t-test, ANOVA, and regression by hand.This undergrad or graduate student would have their first dataset complete but would not know how to analyze it (a problem many people run into if they do not take acourse using R).
The skills I am hoping to convey include the basics of R, how to set up your data so it can be run in R, how to upload your dataset in R, running statistics in R, and how to interpret the data.
To follow along, download ExampleDataset.csv and R (explained in the PowerPoint) to run statistical analyses.
For further practice, download ExampleDataset5dph.csv and ExampleDataset16dph.csv for statistical analyses that are a bit more complicated than the example shown in the PowerPoint.
I have also included an R script with all of the code I used for this lecture. If you need help with the code to run, this is what you want to look for.
Happy computing!
